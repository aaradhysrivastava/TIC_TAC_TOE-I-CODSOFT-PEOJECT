Tic-Tac-Toe AI Project

This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python with a graphical interface using Tkinter.

Features:
- Play against an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to be unbeatable.
- Three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- Sound effects play on each move (Windows only by default).
- A game timer displays how long the current game has been running.
- The game resets automatically after win, lose, or tie.

Technologies and Concepts Used:
- Python 3 — main programming language.
- Tkinter — for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Minimax Algorithm — for AI decision-making in Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Alpha-Beta Pruning — optimization of Minimax to improve AI efficiency.
- Winsound — for playing simple sound effects on Windows.
- Pygame (optional) — for cross-platform sound support.
- Game Timer — implemented with `time` and Tkinter’s `after` method to show elapsed game time.
- Messagebox — Tkinter pop-ups to display game results.
- Random module — used for AI moves on easier difficulty levels.

To run the project, use Python 3 and run the `tic_tac_toe_ai.py` script.
Optionally, install `pygame` for cross-platform sound support.

Enjoy the game!
